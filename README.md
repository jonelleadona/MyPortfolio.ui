# Responsive Portfolio Homework Assignment

For this assignment I created a working site that contains a responsive portfolio based on me. This site renders will on multiple screen variations such as smaller display monitors or for simple web browser resizing. This site may seem simple now, but it is only the beginning of my web develop journey. 

## Some Features to be Found:
The working navbar at the top allows the user to click on three different buttoms. Each button will direct the user to different HTML pages based on which button is clicked.
When resizing the page, notice how the content layout will adapt based on the size set.
